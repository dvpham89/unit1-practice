    <p class="overview">Hi, my name is Duy and I am a 33 year old first generation Vietnamese American. 
    I currently work in the cosmetology field in a management role, where I have 8 years of experience.
    In my free time I enjoy immersing myself in other worlds and stories, whether its by reading a book, 
    watching a movie or show, or playing a game.</p>

    <h2 id="my-start">How I got my start</h2>
    <p>I have been interested in the tech industry for a while now but had been apprehensive about joining a boot camp.
    Recently though, I have met quite a few people who work in the coding field and have been inquiring about their personal 
    insights and experiences. After hearing all of their responses and making sure I had the appropriate time and resources
    available, I decided to pull the trigger and go for it so here I am.</p>
    <p>One of my close friends went through the boot camp at Grand Circus and highly recommended it to me.
    He said that although the program is fast paced and rigorous, the time and effort you put into it will 
    be well rewarded.</p>
